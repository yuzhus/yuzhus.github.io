<p>
  Welcome! I am a third-year PhD student in the EEECS Department at Queen's University Belfast (QUB), under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mienvan/?pli=1">Dr. Mien Van</a> and Prof. Sean McLoone. My research interests mostly lies in the control theory and machine learning for human-robot interaction/collaboration. My recent focus has been on the development of reinforcement learning-enhanced digital twins for physical human-robot collaboration using OpenAI Gym. The overarching goal of my research is to achieve compliant, safe, and stable behavior of collaborative robots when interacting with humans and their environment.
