  Hello! I am a third-year PhD student in the <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/eeecs/">EEECS</a> Department at Queen's University Belfast (QUB), under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mienvan/?pli=1">Dr. Mien Van</a> and <a href="https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/persons/se%C3%A1n-mcloone">Prof. Sean McLoone</a>. My research interests mostly lie in the control theory and machine learning for human-robot interaction/collaboration.
</p>

<p>
 My recent focus has been on the development of reinforcement learning-enhanced digital twins for physical human-robot collaboration using OpenAI Gym. The overarching goal of my research is to achieve compliant, safe, and stable behavior of collaborative robots when interacting with humans and their environment.
