Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/eeecs/">EEECS</a> Department at Queen's University Belfast (QUB), working on the project <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crackmap_ilosta-crack-map-queens-university-belfast-activity-7234817084763815937-Xw5G?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios">'Offshore Wind Turbine Blade Monitoring Using Computer Vision and AI'</a>, funded by Innovate UK. My research focuses on developing a fully customised autonomous drone capable of navigating within GPS-denied wind turbine blades using SLAM and computer vision.

I recently completed my PhD at QUB under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mienvan/?pli=1">Dr Mien Van</a> and <a href="https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/persons/se%C3%A1n-mcloone">Prof Sean McLoone</a>. My research focused on control theory and the development of machine learning-enhanced digital twins for human-robot collaboration. The primary goal was to enable collaborative robots to interact safely, compliantly, and stably with humans and their environments.
