<p>At Queen's, I am serving as a demonstrator for Electronical Engineering (ELE1056), and a teaching assistant for Robotics and Intelligent Systems (ELE4024).</p>
<p>Additionally, I've actively participated in the QUB Teaching Innovation Project as a student instructor. I have helped with the organization of two robotic workshops with <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/eeecs/News/GirlsIntoElectronics.html">Baxter Robot</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FunFizz/HungryRobot">Hungry Robot</a> for local high school students. </p>
