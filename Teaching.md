<p>At Queen's, I am serving as a demonstrator for Electronical Engineering (ELE1056), and a teaching assistant for Robotics and Intelligent Systems (ELE4024).</p>
<p>Additionally, I've actively participated in the <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/eeecs/News/GirlsIntoElectronics.html">Girls Into Electronics</a> project, which is sponsored by <a href="https://www.ukesf.org/">UK Electronics Skills Foundation</a>. This project aims to inspire and encourage female students to pursue studies in electronics engineering and computer science.</p>
