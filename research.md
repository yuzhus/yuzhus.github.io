    description: With a focus on safety and compliance, this study seeks to test the hypothesis "an RL agent can conduct collision-free human-robot collaborative tasks while demonstrating compliant behaviour when they identify human collaborative intentions through the visual and force observation". To achieve this goal, this project built a digital twin and train an end-to-end RL model for human-robot collaborative tasks.

    description: Physical human-robot collaboration requires strict safety guarantees, due to the fact that robots and humans work in a shared workspace. This work presents a novel control framework to handle safety-critical position-based constraints for human-robot physical interaction. The proposed methodology is based on admittance control and exponential control barrier functions to achieve compliance during the force interaction between human and robot, while simultaneously guaranteeing safety constraints.


  - title: Fixed-time Integral Sliding Mode Control for Physical Human-Robot Collaboration

      alt: sand
    description: This work proposes a novel fixed-time integral sliding mode control for admittance control to enhance physical human-robot collaboration. The proposed method combines the benefits of compliance to external forces of admittance control and high robustness to uncertainties of integral sliding mode control (ISMC), such that the system can collaborate with a human partner in an uncertain environment effectively.
